# Tic Tac Toe game in Pure React
## step by step flow 
- Setup react project using vite 
- Make an Ui of tic tac toe 
- use state for store content of each box also for some tailwind css to
  hide and visible card of game over and draw 
- We can also use states for player like 'X' and 'O' 
- for tic tac toe structure we can use map to iterate over an state which 
  contain 9 empty element initially but after that when a user click on any div 
  then coz we use map function so we have an access of index like in which index we 
  actually click and using spread operator use can make an new board the add previous
  values and using that index push new value "X" or "O" whatever
- rest logic is simple like display:none which is hidden in tailwind css
- reset function which is filling all array as empty strings 
- draw function which is also checking all arrays are empty or not if yes then false 
  if all filled then its probably is a draw
